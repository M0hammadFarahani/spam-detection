# Spam Email Detection

This project focuses on building a **classification model** to detect and classify spam emails using a dataset of real email samples.

## 📌 Project Objective  
To design a machine learning model that can **accurately distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) emails** based on key features extracted from email data.

## 📊 Dataset  
- **Source**: [Enron Spam Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- **Size**: 33,345 email records  
- **Features**: 5 columns including email content and metadata

## 🧹 Data Cleaning  
- Handled missing values and cleaned the dataset to prepare it for modeling  
- Basic text preprocessing and formatting

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn

## 🤖 Modeling  
- Built a classification model using Scikit-learn  
- Trained and tested on the cleaned dataset  
- Achieved an accuracy of approximately **95%**

## 🚀 Future Work  
- Explore NLP techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings  
- Try advanced models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or even Neural Networks  
- Evaluate using additional metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score
